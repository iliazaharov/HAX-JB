        The integration of GenAI in software development teams has the potential to transform traditional workflows, communication, and collaboration methods. As AI tools become more accessible and robust, many teams are beginning to rely on them to streamline problem-solving, knowledge sharing, and task management. However, the impact of AI on team dynamics, productivity, and knowledge transfer remains underexplored. By examining when, why, and how software developers choose AI over human interactions, this study aims to uncover the patterns and behaviors that emerge, providing insight into the evolving role of AI within collaborative team environments.

      <p>
        The primary goal of this study is to explore how GenAI changes the way software development teams work, investigating how GenAI improves or deteriorates team communication and problem-solving. It also aims to examine what aspects of traditional workflows or human roles are replaced or become obsolete due to AI assistants. As a result, we hope to identify usage patterns and factors that correlate with team success or challenges in using AI, aiding in the formulation of best practices for AI integration.

        At JetBrains, we have a lot of data that could be analyzed to derive trends and changes in developers' behavior in the IDE under the effect of AI integration. We want to use this data to predict the field's further development.

      <div class="section-title">Goals</div>
      <p>
        The goal of the project is to derive trends in AI-affected metrics of in-IDE activity. We also want to understand and define changes of metrics of in-IDE activity that might be attributed to AI integration. This knowledge of trends can be later used for developing new in-IDE AI features for better user satisfaction.

        An essential part of the success of tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT is their interface. While some of these models' capabilities were available before, the tools brought them to larger audiences without dramatically disrupting their workflow or requiring lots of additional steps. IDE users have their own workflows and the injection of new complex features, such as LLM-based ones, is a non-trivial task. We believe that there is significant space for innovation in the field of Human-AI interaction. While chat is a popular and user-friendly way of using LLMs, we believe there are better ways to utilize them in IDEs.

      <p>
        The goal of this project is to embed emerging LLMs practices as code generation or code explanation into the developer workflow without disturbing the user and improving their productivity.
